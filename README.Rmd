# datasauRus
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stephlocke/datasauRus.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stephlocke/datasauRus)

This package wraps the awesome Datasaurus Dozen dataset.

The Datasaurus was created by Alberto Cairo in this great [blog post](http://www.thefunctionalart.com/2016/08/download-datasaurus-never-trust-summary.html).

Datasaurus shows us why visualisation is important, not just summary statistics.

He's been subsequently made even more famous in the paper [Same Stats, Different Graphs: Generating Datasets with Varied Appearance and Identical Statistics through Simulated Annealing](https://www.autodeskresearch.com/publications/samestats) by Justin Matejka and George Fitzmaurice.

In the paper, Justin and George simulate a variety of datasets that the same summary statistics to the Datasaurus but have very different distributions.

This package looks to make these datasets available for use as an advanced [Anscombe's Quartet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet), available in R as `anscombe`.

## Install
Currently, only available on GitHub, so use `devtools` to install the package

```r
devtools::install_github("stephlocke/datasauRus")
```

## Usage
You can use the package to produce Anscombe plots and more.

```{r fig.height=12, fig.width=9}
library(ggplot2)
library(datasauRus)
ggplot(datasaurus_dozen, aes(x=x, y=y, colour=dataset))+
  geom_point()+
  theme_void()+
  theme(legend.position = "none")+
  facet_wrap(~dataset, ncol=3)
```

## Tests
```{r}
library(devtools)
test()
```

datasauRus
==========

This package wraps the awesome Datasaurus Dozen dataset.

The Datasaurus was created by Alberto Cairo in this great [blog post](http://www.thefunctionalart.com/2016/08/download-datasaurus-never-trust-summary.html).

He's been subsequently made even more famous in the paper [Same Stats, Different Graphs: Generating Datasets with Varied Appearance and Identical Statistics through Simulated Annealing](https://www.autodeskresearch.com/publications/samestats) by Justin Matejka and George Fitzmaurice.

This package looks to make these data sets available.
